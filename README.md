## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Submit their email address using an `input` field
- Receive an error message when the `form` is submitted if:
	- The `input` field is empty. The message for this error should say *"Whoops! It looks like you forgot to add your email"*
	- The email address is not formatted correctly (i.e. a correct email address should have this structure: `name@host.tld`). The message for this error should say *"Please provide a valid email address"*

### Screenshot

I will include screenshots in my GitHub repository.

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

Most of this project was just review for me. I've done all of these things before, but never so quickly and with so few errors. 

This is the second time I've done email validation, and it went a lot smoother this time. I am hoping that I did it correctly but I didn't ever get feedback on my last project with it so I'm not sure yet.

### Continued development

I think this project has shown that I'm ready to move up a level in difficulty. I'm still planning on completing all the Newbie challenges, but I'm excited to start working on Junior challenges to improve my abilities. I've also been following tutorials to create basic games using JavaScript, to hopefully improve my skills. I'm still having difficulty in structuring my JavaScript so I'm going to need to practice it a lot. I'm also going to have to practice Grid even more, even though I hate it.

### Useful resources

- [Resource 1](https://fontawesome.com/) - This is where I got the social media icons.
